# The Most Awesomest Thing Ever 2

A small, fun powerscaling webapp

## Summary

TMATE2 is an app built on `create-react-app` that aims to preserve the legacy of [The Most Awesomest Thing Ever](http://www.mostawesomestthingever.com/), which unfortunately, uses Adobe Flash, and as such may not work going into the future.

This app was made over the span of four days, and uses the entirety of the English Wikipedia, so some comparisons that come up may be asinine or obscure. This is intentional.

## Setup / Build

1. Clone this repo.
1. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode.

## Acknowledgements

This app would not have been made had it not been for [Khalid Williams](https://github.com/khalidwilliams), who kept my ideas grounded (although, not _all_ of them.) I'd also like to thank my mother, who listened to my ramblings about things she very much did not understand.
